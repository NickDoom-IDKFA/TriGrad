# TriGrad

Gradient filling of triangles. A simple code snippet of one of the basic algorithms (nearly as basic as Bubble Sort).

With a launcher and some test examples.

Each triangle of a network must have X, Y and Value. Value is interpolated inside the triangle. Edges are rounded correctly (neither overlap nor holes). The interpolation itself is linear.
